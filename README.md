# KnightGame
This is a simple game programmed in Scala. LibGDX is used as a framework. I really couldn't think of a name, so I just called this KnightGame. If you have a better idea, please let me know.

To run the game, type `activator desktop/run` in a terminal.

To package the game, type `activator desktop/universal:packageBin` in a terminal.
